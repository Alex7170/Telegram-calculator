Hello! This is code for telegram bot. My bot is a bot calculator that can calculate big numbers. Now it can count only in format "digit" "sign" "digit" format, but soon i hope i will add more oportunities. 

This bot-index page and parser for the calculating is writen in TypeScipt. All the packages you needed is in package.json. You can install them by writing npm i in your console. And then you can make bot work by writing npm run start in the terminal.
